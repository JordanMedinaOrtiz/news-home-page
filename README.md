  This project is my personal interpretation of the "News Homepage" challenge by Frontend Mentor. The main goal was to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the process, I tackled key decisions including semantic HTML structure, layout design with CSS Grid, and the integration of Tailwind—from setup and configuration to production bundling. Additionally, JavaScript was used to implement an interactive hamburger menu, adding a layer of interactivity to the overall experience.

<h1 align="center">Objective</h1>

<p>
  The News Homepage was a great opportunity to apply and refine my skills with CSS Grid for layout creation. Design decisions played a critical role in building an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface. Tailwind CSS provided speed and consistency in styling, while JavaScript added interactivity by enabling a responsive hamburger menu for mobile navigation.
